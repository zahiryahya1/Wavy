# Wavy
a game where you avoid enemies boxes.

Overview: This was my first game I bult, But will not be the last. It is not 100% fully completed
          but the rest can be additional add ones like more levels, more option, a leader board etc. 
          There is one "bug" but that also can be easily fixed. I had a lot of fun creating this game
          and learned a lot abount designing games ( or OOP ). Ive left comments throughout my code if
          you would like to look at and understand it.
