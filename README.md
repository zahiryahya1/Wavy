# Wavy
a game where you avoid enemies boxes.

Overview: This was my first game I bult, But will not be the last. It is not 100% fully completed
          but the rest can be additional add ones like more levels, more option, a leader board etc. 
          There is one "bug" but that also can be easily fixed. I had a lot of fun creating this game
          and learned a lot abount designing games ( or OOP ). Ive left comments throughout my code if
          you would like to look at and understand it. 
          
Overview of code: I used a LinkedList data structure to store all the objects. It uses a simple game logic 
          you can find on the internet. There is a abstract gameObject class that all objects inherent. each tick,
          all the objects in the list will do what it needs to do. If you want a more in depth discription of how 
          the game is created, each file has a summary and comments of what it does and how it does it.
